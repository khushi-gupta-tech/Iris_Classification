# Iris_Classification

# Overview
This project implements a Decision Tree model to classify the species of the Iris flower based on its physical characteristics (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The project includes a Django web application for user interaction, enabling real-time classification through a simple interface.

#Features

. Classifies Iris species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica.

. Implements a Decision Tree Classifier for accurate and interpretable predictions.

. Provides a Django-powered web interface for user input and real-time classification.

. Displays classification results along with key insights about the dataset.

# Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Description: The dataset consists of 150 samples with the following attributes:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (target variable)

# Technologies Used

-> Backend

  . Django: Web framework for backend development.
